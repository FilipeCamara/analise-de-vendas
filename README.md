<h1>Pandas-Sales-Analysis-Task</h1>

> Status: Finished

### I used Python (Pandas and Matplotlib) to clean, analyze and answer business questions about 9 stores located in different states. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by Product, Date, Store, Price, etc.

### The challange was proposed by a Brazilian YouTube Channel called 'HashTag Programacao'. Where he shows 3 problems related to Data Science/Data Engineering that can be used as a small project on GitHub.
